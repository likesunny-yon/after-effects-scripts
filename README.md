# After Effects Scripts

A collection of helpful scripts for After Effects that run natively or with a 3rd party script launcher such as [kbar2](https://aescripts.com/kbar), [Tool Launcher](https://aescripts.com/tool-launcher/), or [Quick Menu 2](https://aescripts.com/quick-menu/).

To run the script natively in After Effects use `File > Script > Run Script File...` and choose this script.
